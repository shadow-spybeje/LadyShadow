#---==‚òÜ Dev Notes ‚òÜ ==---
  ##-- Random Comments from the Developers --

‚Ä¢ SRPG
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The SRPG will no longer be hosted Directly inside of Shadow.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Instead it will be hosted seperatly.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Shadow, among other SpyaBeje Bots will be able to access the SRPG_DB, this will grant access to these Bots, and their Users a seemless connection to the Very Same SRPG World!!
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ User A on Bot-Shadow can play with User B on Bot-Gidjet!!



‚Ä¢ Commands
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Not all of the commands are yet functioning. However, most of them have been rewritten/configured to run along side the [v.4] rewrite.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ If you notice any issues or Bugs, please report them to the Bot Developers immediatly!!
